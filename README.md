# Hippodrome

Write a program for accepting bets and calculating winnings on horse races. Users registered in the system can bet any amount on one of the seven horses. Previously, the system administrator enters a list of horses. According to the results of the race (it can be modeled based on random numbers), the winning amount should be calculated.
